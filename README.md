# 20201112_Anatomie_Seminar

My talk for the internal seminar at the Institute of Anatomy on November 12, 2020.

Heavily based on my [lecture on (micro)tomography](https://github.com/habi/lecture.microtomography), probably I could just have forked the repository.
The first part of the talk is an introduction to microCT imaging, the second part is a rundown on [the tooth analysis method](https://habi.github.io/zmk-tooth-cohort-method-manuscript/) for the staff of the [Institute of Anatomy](https://www.ana.unibe.ch/index_eng.html).
